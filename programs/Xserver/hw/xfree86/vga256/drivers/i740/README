5. Configuration

   The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
   initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
   section of your XF86Config file are:

       Section "Device"
           Identifier "i740"
       EndSection

   or let xf86config or XF86Setup do this for you.

   However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

       VideoRam - in kilobytes
       DacSpeed - in MHz
       MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
       IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers


6. Driver Options

   "hw_cursor" - request hardware cursor (default)
   "sw_cursor" - software cursor only
   "no_accel"  - software rendering only
   "sgram"     - force the use of SGRAM timing info
   "sdram"     - force the use of SDRAM timing info

   Note: the i740 X server should automatically detect whether your
         card has SGRAM or SDRAM.  Use the "sgram" and "sdram" options
         if it is incorrectly detected.


7. Known Limitations

   * Certain drawing operations are very slow when using 24 bit per
     pixel depth mode.  We hope to fix this in a future release.
