Accelerated options for XF68_FBDev on top of pm2fb
--------------------------------------------------

I am mainly combining the mach64 and glint acceleration routines.
Where I wasn't sure if I implemented something correctly, I just commented out
the original source.

If you want to add new object files, edit Imakefile and do 'make Makefile'. By
doing 'make DEBUG="-Wall -DDEBUG"' you will see all the warnings and the binary
will contain lots of debug output, which will slow down the operation.

Note that a lot isn't fully implemented yet, and it's probable you will encoun-
strange behaviour or even crashes. If so, please report with the full server
output.
