<title>Information for i810 Users - i810 Driver Version 1.0.0
<date>21 October 1999
<toc>

<sect>Supported Hardware
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Intel 810 motherboards
</itemize>


<sect>Features
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Full support for 8, 15, 16 and 24 bit per pixel depths.
  <item>Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.
  <item>Hardware accelerated 2D drawing engine support for 8, 15, 16 and
        24 bit per pixel depths.
  <item>Support for high resolution video modes up to 1600x1200.
  <item>Fully programmable clock supported.
  <item>Robust text mode restore for VT switching.
</itemize>

<sect>Technical Notes
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>32 bpp is unaccelerated on this chipset, and unsupported by this driver.
  <item>Interlace modes cannot be supported.
  <item>Normal use requires agpgart.o module, distributed with the server.
</itemize>

<sect>Reported Working Video Cards
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Intel evaluation hardware
</itemize>


<sect>Configuration
<p>
The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to
initialize the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device"
section of your XF86Config file are:
<verb>
       Section "Device"
           Identifier "i810"
       EndSection
</verb>
or let xf86config or XF86Setup do this for you. NOTE: config
programs have not been tested, yet.

However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:
<itemize>
  <item>DacSpeed - in MHz
  <item>MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer
  <item>IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers
</itemize>

In order to use most resolutions, it is necessary to install the
'agpgart.o' module which accompanies this server.  You will probably
have to compile the module yourself (see the notes in the module).

Note: the i810 X server detects whether your motherboard has
display cache video memory.  This memory is has reduced bandwidth
compared to 'normal' system memory, and isn't used by the server.  The
main function of this memory is for ancillary buffers (eg. z buffer)
in a forthcoming 3d capable server.

<sect>Driver Options
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>"no_accel"  - software rendering only
</itemize>



<sect>Known Limitations
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>No 3d support in this release.
</itemize>
