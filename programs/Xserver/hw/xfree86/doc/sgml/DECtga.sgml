<sect>DEC 21030
<p>
<itemize>
<item>The DEC 21030 is supported by XFree86 in this release of XFree86 3.3.

<item>Current Known Problems

<enum>
<item>Only one modeline is accepted, this will be the first viable one
that matches other criteria.

<item>Due to the above, Virtual Resolutions is not supported either.
</enum>

<item>The following options may be specified for the 21030 driver:
<descrip>
<tag>Option "dac_8_bit"</tag>
	Turn on 8Bit BT485 RamDac (Multia and 8-plane TGA only).
<tag>Option "dac_6_bit"</tag>
	Turn on 6Bit BT485 RamDac (Multia and 8-plane TGA only).
<tag>MemBase 0x???????</tag>
	If the server does not detect the base address of the 21030, then
	Check /proc/pci for the 21030 and look for the "Prefetchable 32 bit
	memory at 0x???????" and enter this as your MemBase setting.
	In XFree86 v3.3.2, if you are using Linux > v2.0.27 with the PCI
	routines the server should detect the base address automatically.

</descrip>
<item>No acceleration features of the 21030 have been taken advantage of yet!
</itemize>

<sect> Additional Notes <p>
This code has been tested only under Linux on DEC's UDB box
(Multia), the ZLZp-E1 (8-plane TGA), and the ZLXp-E2 (24-plane
TGA).  The ZLXp-E3 (24-plane+3D TGA) is untested but should work.
